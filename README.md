# TkxGram
Crossplatform GUI desktop client for Telegram written in Perl and Tcl/Tk

Have you ever tried to use official Telegram clients **for work**, not entertainment? Noticed how often you need to switch between private chat with colleague (or two) and work chatting group, and constantly scroll up and down to needed place in that chat and back to new messages?

This is for those who tired of "modern" fancy-bells-and-whistles UI fashion and wants classic while being more organized.

Interface is based on ideas from Irssi and Vim: tabs and splits allow you to see several chats (in fact, even "views" to different postions in same chat) on screen at the same time (top-level windows are also allowed).

## DEPENDS

Based on [Teleperl](https://github.com/vgadfly/teleperl) library and Tkx bridge between Perl and Tcl/Tk. See there "for GUI app".
